## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our movie recommendation system using a content-based filtering approach! In this project, we recommend movies to users based on the attributes of the movies such as genre, director, cast, plot, and keywords. This README will guide you through the project structure and provide essential information for understanding and replicating our work.

## Project's Overview
Our project focuses on leveraging content-based filtering algorithms to recommend movies. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

## Data Collection
Extracted movie data including genres, cast, director, and plot descriptions from a movie dataset.

## Feature Extraction
Processed and converted textual data into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

## Similarity Calculation
Calculated the similarity between movies using cosine similarity on the extracted features.

## Recommendation Engine
Developed a recommendation engine that suggests movies similar to the ones liked by the user based on content features.

## User Interface
Created a simple user interface for users to input their favorite movies and get recommendations.
